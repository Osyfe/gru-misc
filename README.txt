A collection of small game oriented utilities in Rust. These include:

- a math library with vectors, matrices and rotors (= right handed quaternions)
- a simple thread pool library
- two text layout libraries, one based of "ab_glyph" for rasterised glyphs and the other based of "easy-signed-distance-field" for sdf glyphs
- a deprecated ui library, superseded by "gru-ui" in its own crate
